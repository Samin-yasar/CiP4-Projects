## 🛠️ How to Play

1. Run the script in the terminal:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Enter your move:
   - `rock`
   - `paper`
   - `scissors`

3. The computer will randomly pick its move:
   - Each move has an equal **1/3 probability** of being chosen (no bias).
   - Example:
     ```
     Round 1
     Enter your move (rock, paper, scissors): rock
     Computer chose: scissors
     ✅ You win this round!
     Score → You: 1 | Computer: 0
     ```

4. First to **5 points wins** the match.

5. After the game ends, choose whether to **play again** or exit.

## 📊 Fairness & Randomness

- The computer’s move is chosen using Python’s built-in:
  ```python
  random.choice(["rock", "paper", "scissors"])
  ```
- Each option (`rock`, `paper`, `scissors`) has equal probability.
- Over many rounds, the distribution is statistically balanced.

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- Works in **Code in Place IDE** and standard Python environments.  
- No third-party libraries needed.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add more moves (`lizard` and `spock`).
- Track **match history**.
- Show **progress bar style score display**.
- Add **multiplayer mode**.
